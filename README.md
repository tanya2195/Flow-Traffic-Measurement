The project is to implement the following six algorithms and data structures
for traffic measurement: Two-level Hash Tables, Hash Table with
Probabilistic Counting, Virtual Bitmap, Virtual FM, Count-Min, and Bloom
filter for membership lookup.
Testing of the algorithms should be performed based on real Internet traffic
.For spread estimation, I have used per-source flows. For size estimation, I have use per-source-destination flows.
For membership lookup, I used each source-destination pair as an element encoded in the Bloom filter.
